      <p>
        In a world of misinformation, abuse of resources, 
        hate & violence, I want to work on projects that aim to 
        help heal our relationships with each other and our planet.
        I believe one way or the other, technology represents the path to the future. 
        I hope to build tools & systems that will help ensure our future is one 
        of balance, prosperity and peace for all. ðŸ––
