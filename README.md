This is my personal website & portfolio. It will showcase my experience,
notable achievements & career history divided into three main categories:

* Software
* Music
* Inline Skating

## Stack
This project is a `ReactJS` application and relies heavily on `React Router` to organize and serve content. I used `CRACO` to configure path aliases, and much of the styling is locally scoped using `CSS Modules`. I will update this section as more dependencies are added to the project.
