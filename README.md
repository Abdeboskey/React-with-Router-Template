# Carolina Reaper Road Race

The Carolina Reaper Road Race is an annual inline speed-skating race in
Greenville, SC. This website will contain the who, what, why, when and where of
the event as well as links to registration and other pertinent information.

## Stack

This project is a `ReactJS` application and relies heavily on `React Router` to
organize and serve content. I used `CRACO` to configure path aliases, and the
site is styled using `Tailwind-CSS`. I will update this section as more
dependencies are added to the project.
